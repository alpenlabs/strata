//! Types relating to epoch bookkeeping.
//!
//! An epoch of a range of sequential blocks defined by the terminal block of
//! the epoch going back to (but not including) the terminal block of a previous
//! epoch.  This uniquely identifies the epoch's final state indirectly,
//! although it's possible for conflicting epochs with different terminal blocks
//! to exist in theory, depending on the consensus algorithm.
//!
//! Epochs are *usually* always the same number of slots, but we're not
//! guaranteeing this yet, so we always include both the epoch number and slot
//! number of the terminal block.
//!
//! We also have a sentinel "null" epoch used to refer to the "finalized epoch"
//! as of the genesis block.
