# Report Generation with Profiling

This binary provides functionality to generate reports and profiling data for proofs generated by `SP1`. Below are the instructions to generate reports and view profiling information.

## Generating Reports

To generate a report, run the following command:

```shell
cargo run --release
```

## Generating Reports with Profiling

To generate a report along with profiling information, use the following command:

```shell
cargo run --release -F profiling
```

This will generate a file with a `.trace` extension containing the profiling data.

## Viewing SP1 Profile

The profiling data can be viewed using [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply). To view the profile:

```bash
samply load <FILENAME>.trace
```

### Installing Samply (Optional)

If you do not already have Samply installed, you can install it using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --locked samply
```

## Notes

- This binary currently supports trace generation (profiling information) exclusively for proofs generated by `SP1`.
- Ensure you have `Cargo` and the necessary dependencies installed to use this tool.
