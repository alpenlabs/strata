secp256k1 = { git = "https://github.com/sp1-patches/rust-secp256k1", branch = "patch-secp256k1-v0.29.1" } # This has been used because on riscv32, we need to build C libraries using the riscv-gnu-toolchain and clang for compiling C code. sp1-patches does this. This works for risc0 as well because the `target_vendor` is not `succinct`, so this does not try to use the succinct precompile.
